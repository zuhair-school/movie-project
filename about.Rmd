## About me
Hey! My name is Zuhair. I live in Canada and go to Iroquois Ridge High School. I love to code, play video games and sports. In 2021, I'm going to 10th grade. This course really interested me and I loved the outcome of it. I really do recommend it but only if you are ready to have lots of work and you are dedicated. You aren't going to like this course if you aren't doing those things. In my opinion, I loved this course. And I hope future students enjoy it too!

## About my Project
Have you ever thought about how movies have so many genres and how they might not be true? Others have thought the same thing. I was also curious about it so I decided to gather data and compose a graph to prove or disprove this. Hope you like the graph and if you have any questions about it, please let me know.
